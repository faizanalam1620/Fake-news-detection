It uses various Machine learning algorithms to detect the fake news. 
-> Using two dataset 'True.csv' and 'False.csv
-> Usng various tools for visualising dataset. Also using wordcloud.

Machine learning algorithms used:
    1. MultiNomial Naive Bayes algorithm
    2. Support Vector Machines
    3. Passive Aggressive Classifier
    4. GloVe (Global Vector)

Modules used: 
    Pandas
    NLTK
    Wordcloud
    Sklearn
    Keras
    Tensorflow
    etc.

Use cases:
 
 Download two datasets True.csv and Fake.csv.

 Download glove model, glove.6D.100d.txt
 
 User will be asked to enter any news in cli, the tool will detect that the news is fake or real.
 
 Also consists tkinter GUI, in which a box will appear to enter news and the result will be published that the news is fake or not based on various algorithms.
